Kiva is an international nonprofit organization, founded in 2005 in San Francisco, with a mission to expand financial access to help underserved communities thrive.
Kiva aims to provide funding for the unbanked and the financially excluded via crowdfunding of loans and unlocking capital for the underserved, improving the quality and cost of financial services, and addressing the underlying barriers to financial access around the world.

In this project we will be visualizing insights using a dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about loans awarded by Kiva.

Using Seaborn, we will be exploring the average loan amount by country using aggregated bar charts. We will also be visualizing the distribution of loan amounts by project type and gender using box plots and violin plots.
